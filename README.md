🚀 Power BI E-commerce Sales Dashboard Project

I recently worked on an exciting project where I helped the Madhav Store develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and track their online sales across India.

📊 Key Highlights:

* Built interactive dashboards to visualize and monitor e-commerce performance.
* Implemented drill-down features using filters and slicers for deeper insights.
* Created data relationships, performed calculations, and enabled user-driven parameters.
* Designed customized visualizations: bar, pie, donut, scatter, line, area charts, maps, and more.

🛠️ Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Visualization Techniques

This hands-on experience helped me enhance my dashboarding and data analysis skills—turning raw data into impactful visual stories!
